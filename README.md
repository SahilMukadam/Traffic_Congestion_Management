# Traffic_Congestion_Management
Global, bbox-driven pipeline that detects and predicts urban congestion. Uses OSM traffic signals + Google ETA pairs to compute cluster-level congestion factors, stores results in PostgreSQL, and visualises current and +5-min predicted flow in SUMO with optional rule-based what-if signal tweaks.

## The Project is ready and is under review
